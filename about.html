        <h1>Yoshitomo Nara</h1>
        <p id="first">Yoshitomo Nara was born on the 5th of December 1959 in Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. He is a
            Japanese artist who lives and works in the Tochigi Prefecture, though his artwork has been exhibited
            worldwide, including the Netherlands. Nara's artistic contributions are not only recognized globally but
            also find homes in prestigious institutions such as the MoMA and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p>

        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <p>Nara grew up in the same Prefecture he was born in, about 500 kilometres north of where he lives now,
            which is the Tochigi Prefecture. His love for and exposure to Western music on the American military
            radio station Far East Network, has influenced his artistic imagination at an early age. Notably, he
            went on to create cover art for various bands, including Shonen Knife, R.E.M., and Bloodthirsty
            Butchers.</p>
        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>While Nara denies stating that manga influenced him, the visual elements from the manga and anime of his
            1960s upbringing are frequently mentioned in discussions about his distinctive, large-eyed figures.
            Despite the apparent influence, Nara deviated from the typical innocence associated with these images;
            injecting a horror-like quality into his works. This fusiom of human malevolence with the image of an
            innocent child could be interpreted as a response to Japan's strict societal norms.</p>
