        <h1>My personal favorites</h1>
        <p>Here are some of my personal favorites with a short desctription with each of them. I chose a few art pieces
            from the last two years, so these pieces aren't that old. Here is my top 3:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Wish for World Peace</li>
            <li>Rock'n Roll is Not Dead</li>
            <li>Death, Death, Death</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>1. Wish for World Peace</h2>
        <p>My first chosen artpiece is called "Wish for World Peace". It was made in the year 2022 and it has these
            measurements: 100 x 90 x 4.5 cm. Momentarily it is entrusted to Aomori Museum of Art in Japan, Aomori Prefecture.</p>
